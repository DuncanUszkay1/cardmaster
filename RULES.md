## TTRPG Shell

Players are **regular humans**. Players can attempt **any action**, rolling a d20 to determine the result.

### Non-Combat Actions

There are no strict rules around the effectiveness of non-combat actions. All are determined by rolling a d20. There are no modifiers outside of the card system.

### Currency

The only currency in the game is **dollars**. Players keep track of their own balances.

### Combat

Combat uses a **damage** and **HP** system. When a character reaches 0 HP or below, they go **unconscious** and can no longer take any actions until they awaken. Characters can only be killed intentionally, except in extreme cases (a character is sucked into a black hole).

Combat is performed in turns. The players all share a turn, as do the NPCs. The players roll once against the DM to determine priority.

### Players

All players have the same stats:

HP: 20

Melee(Unarmed): 1d4

Melee(Armed): 1d6

Ranged(Armed): 1d4

Ranged Attacks have a **hit rate** based on the difficulty of the shot:

Easy(point blank, a few metres away, unmoving target): 100%

Medium(Moving target, 2m+ away): 50% (10 or higher)

Hard(Moving target, 20m+ away): DM's choice. At best 20%(16 or higher)

When a player goes **unconscious** they **choose one card out of both inventory and hand to keep**, then **discard the rest**. **They also lose all the money they're holding**. Players may be killed from an unconscious state, but only intentionally.

### NPCs

NPCs have a predetermined amount of HP.

NPCs do not use cards.

NPCs have up to one special ability defined by the DM.

NPC's should be extremely easy to play, to avoid distracting the DM.

All NPCs share the same turn, and roll a single dice for initiative against the Players.

### Default NPC

In the case where an NPC doesn't have combat information predetermined by the DM, the DM will pick from one of the two following options for the characters combat information:

**Healthy:**
HP: 5

Damage stats the same as the Player

**Frail:**
HP: 1

Unable to deal damage

## Card System

**Cards** can be used to activate special abilities. Cards can be used **instantaneously** at **anytime**, **including the NPCs combat turn**. Card abilities are guaranteed to succeed, though they may not achieve the desired effect, depending on usage.

Players can hold up to **15 cards in their hand**, and **as many as they'd like in their inventory**.

Players can place cards in and take cards out of their **inventory** at any time, treating them like ordinary physical objects within the Game World.

To use a card, it must be in the Player's **hand**. To put cards in their **hand**, a player must **rest**. To **rest**, the player must sleep for **8 interrupted game hours**. After resting, a player returns to 20 HP and may put cards from their **inventory** into their **hand** until they reach the **hand size limit**.

Cards each have a **tier**. Tiers are each associated with a colour, using the following order:

Grey, Blue, Green, Red, Gold

Where Grey is the lowest tier, and Gold is the highest tier.

Most cards are kept in **decks** organized by tiers. Each card has a secret rarity, and an infinite supply.

Some cards can only be acquired under special conditions.

### Acquiring Cards

Cards can be found, purchased, stolen, dropped, and traded for. Players cannot steal from other Players.

### Card Exchange

There are three card exchanges which are always available for Players to use on cards in their **inventory**. When these trades are made, the cards the players offer are returned the the deck of the appropriate tier. Those trades are as follows:

3 cards of the same tier -> 1 random card of tier tier above

For example, a player could trade Hurt(Grey), Heal(Grey), and Fluster(Grey) to draw Jump(Blue) from the Green deck.

Any 1 card -> 1 random card of a lower tier

For example, a player could trade Leap(Green) to randomly draw Ignite(Grey) from the Grey deck.

3 cards with the same name -> 1 Upgraded version of that card

For example, a player could trade 3 copies of Jump(Blue) to draw exactly Leap(Green) from the Green deck.

**Note that not all cards have upgrades- if a card has an upgraded version it'll be indicated on the typeline.**
