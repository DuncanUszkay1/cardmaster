# Campaign: Gerraro's Bandits

## Background - The Creation of the Tower

Many ages ago, a city known as Oran led the known world in the development of advanced magic and technology. Their crowning achievement was the creation of a decentralized artificial intelligence known as "The Mainframe". It was a system which connected every technological device in the city, and allowed for unparalleled coordination and efficiency. The crowning achievement of the Mainframe was its ability to design and enact its own expansion. City blocks were raised from the dust in a matter of days, and occasionally torn down even faster. The Mainframe relied upon human feedback to parametrize its own success, and providing that feedback accurately became the sole occupation of its citizens.

One day, a cataclysmic event occurred which destroyed Oran completely. The details of this event have been lost to time, but it's assumed that same event also destroyed the rest of the known world, leaving behind a deep, dead ocean. The Mainframe however, remained. It managed to resuscitate a single man, named Polonius. He begged the machine to return him home to his loving wife. The Mainframe set itself to its task, starting on a quest which would span millions of years. 

The Mainframe expanded itself thousands of miles in every direction- claiming every resource in existence as its own. A massive structure was formed to support endless numbers of independent worlds. This would come to be known as "The Tower". Within the Tower, the Mainframe taught itself how to manipulate worlds through a process of extensive trial and error. Eventually, the ability to create life, and even re-create humanity, had become a trivial mechanism.

Eventually it had completed its quest and produced a living replication of Oran. It was a perfect duplicate based on all archival records saved within the Mainframe. Polonius was awakened and presented with the image of his wife, who was now living again deep within the Tower. He met her with disgust. She was an imposter, he claimed, and an insult to her memory. He went on to curse the replicated city as well, calling it hollow and lacking the essence which made Oran great.

The negative feedback had reset everything the Mainframe had learned. It no longer sought a perfect re-creation, but it didn't know what else to pursue. It used the tools it had developed over millennia, the ability to create humanity and shape societies, and set off in random directions. It created worlds the size of a city block, worlds in which humans never discover electricity, worlds which embrace technology in an even greater capacity than Oran. All these worlds receive the same rejection from Polonius, but without an alternative the Mainframe is simply continuing on its new path, up to this very day.

## Background - Within the Tower

With the proliferation of human worlds within the Tower, the escape from its structures was inevitable. Sufficiently advanced societies of humans eventually discovered that the worlds they lived in were controlled by a larger system, and that they were at risk of having their own world destroyed and reclaimed for resources. Some merely fled their worlds for others, some managed to wrestle control from the Mainframe and take back control of their world. The most prominent of these groups are known simply as "The Rebels", a militant alliance of human worlds with complete control over the technology in their sector. They're headquartered in the original recreation of Oran. Their leader is the re-creation of Polonius, though he more typically goes by "The General".

The Tower is administrated through a network of messaging nodes, each transmitting requests in all directions. Each hop in the network adds some noise into the channel, causing messages from far away to be completely indecipherable. Individual components can be understood and hijacked, but it's impossible to understand the entire network due to its size and complexity. The creation and destruction of worlds, and what is learned with each new experiement, remains a mystery to the human race.

Most day-to-day work in the Tower is performed by Agents. Agents are humanoid robots designed to infiltrate and manipulate the development of worlds within the Tower to maximize data collection. They all belong to distinct Agencies which operate independently, directed by the cryptic messages emitted back and forth over the network. Oftentimes the interpretations of these messages conflict, causing conflicts between Agencies. They're currently engaged in a hundred year war with the Rebels, trying to recover lost ground.

Inter-world networks and cartels have formed among the human escapees. Vast fortunes are realized in the unspoiled, resource rich cubes populated by primitive societies. These societies are helpless to defend themselves against the superior technology wielded by their invaders. Their fate is destitution and slavery, as the resources of their world are extracted for external interests. These riches are primarily centralized in an organization simply known as "The Mafia". They enjoy luxury and indulge in all forms of entertainment. A visit to their extravagant mall world or the infamous fighting ring will teach you all you need to know. Their leader is given the title of "The Don", who rules the organization with an iron fist.

## Premise - Gerraro's Bandits

There's another important faction within the Tower, led by the eccentric grand thief Gerraro. Gerraro was one of the first escapees in the Tower, and claimed much of its treasure as his own. Around him, rumours abound. He's said to be the richest man alive, as well as immortal. Many fear facing him in battle- his massive collection of magical items, the extent of which is unknown, leaves his combat capabilities a mystery. He has stolen from everyone- the Mafia, the Rebels, and every Agency. Though he's a criminal, he's a valued ally of every faction in the Tower due to his vast knowledge and consistent neutrality in conflict.

Gerraro's greatest prize is his hideout, a world of his own which houses bandits and runaways. Due to his special status, the hideout is sheltered from the larger conflicts of the Tower, making it a popular destination for refugees. When they arrive however, they find it to be a lawless place full of dangerous criminals. What little order there is comes from the influence of Gerraro's bandits and the Mafia, who use it as a safe-house and recruitment ground.

Surrounding Gerraro are bands of hired mercenaries, from all walks of life. They're given paid contracts to retrieve certain items, gather information, or assassinate targets. The Players gathered today are new members of the banditry, each joining for their own reason, be it money, fame, or something else entirely. They've all been assigned to a single team, as most new members are, to allow them to tackle harder missions. For better or worse, they have no choice but to cooperate with each other.
