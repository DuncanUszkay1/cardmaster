# Setup

Provide a quick introduction of the world, covering various roles, factions, etc that could be used in character creation.

Deal out 15 Grey cards to each Player's Inventory.

Draw 3 Green cards for each Player creating a character, redrawing if a duplicate is drawn.

Each Player chooses one Green card and places it in their hand. 

Give each Player two copies of the card they chose and place it in their hand.

Players are then allowed to fill up their hand (to the limit of 15) with Grey cards from their inventory.

Return all extra Green cards to the deck.

Each Player creates a Character. A character consists of:

- A name
- A picture
- A backstory

The name and a bank balance of 100 dollars is recorded on a sheet in front of each Player.
