# Cardmaster

Cardmaster is a tabletop RPG which uses a basic TTRPG shell with the addition of a card based ability system.

This ruleset assumes some basic familiarity with the terminology and play patterns of TTRPG games.

## Goals
- Allowing for the 'try-anything' gameplay provided TTRPGs like Dungeons and Dragons
- Emphasizing the collection and use of large volumes of cards
