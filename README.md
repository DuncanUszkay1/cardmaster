# Cardmaster

Cardmaster is a tabletop RPG which uses a basic TTRPG shell with the addition of a card based ability system.

## Goals
- Allowing for the 'try-anything' gameplay provided TTRPGs like Dungeons and Dragons
- Emphasizing the collection and use of large volumes of cards

## Overview

The base game acts like a simplified version of DnD with no stats, races, or classes.

To replace classes, this game uses **cards**. Players can use cards at anytime to gain a superhuman advantage over their opponents.

Here's an example card:

By using this card, the Player's character will jump 3 meters high, considerably higher then any real human can jump.

The power of cards isn't just what's written in the textbox- it comes from the Player's ability to play the card **instantaneously, at any time**. This means that Players can use their cards to react to events like a sudden rockslide, or an enemy's attack. It also means that Players can **play multiple cards at once**. Consider the card "Boost":

While this effect isn't particularly impressive on its own, if many are used at once you could turn a mediocre roll into a critical success.

Rather than using a leveling system like in DnD, Players in Cardmaster grow stronger by acquiring more powerful cards. Weaker cards can be combined to have a shot at more powerful cards, like Immolate:

Eventually players will start to acquire cards of the highest tier, Gold cards like Inner Sun:

To encourage use, cards can be reused once per 'day'. A 'day' is defined as the time period between two 8 hour uninterrupted periods of sleeping. Players need to conserve their cards strategically, and constantly seek out safe places to rest. This continual need to rest to refresh your cards acts as a predictable game loop in which players need to enter strange inns, camp in the wilderness, and take careful consideration of time passing.

Players might consider using social cards to convince a home owner to let them stay the night:

Or maybe strike out into the woods, spray some monster deterrent, and hope for the best:
